# Text-Emotion-Classification using Deep Learning Model

This project aims to classify emotions in text using a deep learning model. It uses TensorFlow, Keras, and natural language processing techniques to build and train the model. The goal is to predict the emotion (like happiness, sadness, anger, etc.) behind a given piece of text.

## Features

- **Text Preprocessing:** Tokenization, padding, and encoding of text data.
- **Model Architecture:** A Sequential model using an embedding layer followed by a dense network for emotion classification.
- **Emotion Prediction:** Real-time emotion prediction using a user-inputted text.
- **Streamlit Web App:** A simple and interactive web interface for users to input text and view predicted emotions.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary language for data processing and machine learning.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For building and training the deep learning model.
- **Streamlit**: For creating an interactive web interface.
- **Scikit-learn**: For data preprocessing and splitting data into training and testing sets.
- **Pandas & Numpy**: For handling data manipulation and numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizations (optional, can be added).
